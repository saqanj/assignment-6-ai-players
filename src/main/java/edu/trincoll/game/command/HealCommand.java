/**
 * Command to heal a character.
 *
 * TODO 4b: Implement execute() and undo()
 *
 * Requirements for execute():
 * 1. Store the target's current health before healing
 * 2. Heal the target: target.heal(amount)
 * 3. Store the target's health after healing
 * 4. Calculate actual healing done (after - before)
 *
 * Requirements for undo():
 * 1. Restore health to before healing
 * 2. Use target.setHealth() to set health directly
 *    (Can't use takeDamage as it applies defense)
 *
 * Note: Need to track actual healing because you can't heal above max health.
